                <p><b>TLDR:</b> Cross-Site Leaks (XS-Leaks) describe a client-side bug that allows
                    an attacker to collect side-channel information from a cross-origin
                    HTTP resource.

                </p>
                <p>
                In our paper, we contribute to the ongoing XS-Leak research by presenting the first formal
                model for XS-Leaks. Our comprehensive analysis of known XS-Leaks reveals that all of them 
                fit into this new model. With the help of this formal approach, we (1) systematically searched for new
                XS-Leak attack classes, (2) implemented XSinator.com, a tool to automatically evaluate if a given web browser is vulnerable to XS-Leaks, 
                and (3) systematically evaluated mitigations for XS-Leaks. We found 14 new attack classes, evaluated the resilience of 56
                different browser/OS combinations against a total of 34 XS-Leaks, and propose a methodology to mitigate XS-Leaks.

                <h6>User States in Webapplications</h6>
                <p>
                    When interacting with a website, a user has a well-defined <i>state</i>
                    – this state typically contains the information whether the user is
                    logged in or not. Besides the login status, the user state may contain
                    account permissions, such as admin privileges, premium membership, 
                    or restricted accounts. The number of different user states
                    is potentially unlimited. For example, in a webmail application, a
                    user may or may not have received an email with the subject <code>top
                    secret</code>.
                </p>
                <h6>Cross-Site Leaks on the User States</h6>
                <p>
                    Cross-Site Leaks on the User States. To distinguish between
                    two user states, the attacker’s JavaScript code must be able to identify 
                    differences in its own execution environment resulting from
                    different responses to cross-origin HTTP requests. These different
                    responses must correspond to different user states at the target web
                    application. If this differentiation is possible, we call this vulnerability 
                    an XS-Leak. The attacker can then craft a malicious website,
                    which triggers the XS-Leak once the victim opens it (see image below). In
                    the following two real-world examples, we try to exemplify the
                    scope of the problem
                </p>

                <h6>XS-Leak Flow Example</h6>

                <p>
                    The victim (1) visits the attacker-controlled website, which (2) uses an inclusion 
                    method to request a state-dependent resource from a target
                    website. The attacker then uses (3) a leak technique to (4)
                    determine the victim’s user state.
